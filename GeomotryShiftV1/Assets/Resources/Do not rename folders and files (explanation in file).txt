Files and folders in the "Resources" folder are referred to by file name in
some scripts. For example, the enemy turret uses a function to decide what
to shoot as a projectile:

Resources.Load("Enemies/EnemyTurretFolder/Enemy Projectile")

Changing the name or folder names will cause the script to break, so leave
file and folder names alone, even if they are misspelled.
